            <p>Theodorus Gerardus Jozef "Theo" Jansen is a Dutch artist. In 1990, he began building large mechanisms out
                of PVC that are able to move on their own and, collectively, are entitled, <em>Strandbeest</em>. The
                kinetic sculptures appear to walk. His animated works are intended to be a fusion of art and
                engineering. He has said that "The walls between art and engineering exist only in our minds." He
                strives to equip his creations with their own artificial intelligence so they may avoid obstacles such
                as the sea, by changing course when detected. Since 1990, Jansen has been creating
                <em>strandbeesten</em> (Dutch for "beach animals", singular <em>strandbeest</em>), which are moving
                kinetic structures, sometimes wind-propelled, that resemble walking animals, described by Jansen as
                artificial life. All of his models are based on a system of triangles and connecting links which convert
                the rotation of an axle into a stepping motion of six or more legs. This allows the
                <em>strandbeesten</em> to travel over sand much more efficiently than if traveling on wheels. What was
                at first a rudimentary "breed" has evolved slowly, with the help of evolutionary computation techniques,
                into a generation of kinetic sculptures that to some degree can react to their environment. According to
                Jansen, he was inspired by The Blind Watchmaker by Richard Dawkins. Jansen has said "I make skeletons
                that are able to walk on the wind. Over time, these skeletons have become increasingly better at
                surviving the elements such as storms and water and eventually I want to put these animals out in herds
                on the beaches, so they will live their own lives."

            <p>Constructed from PVC piping, wood, fabric airfoils, and zip ties, Jansen's sculptures are constantly
                being improved and are designed to function in the sandy beach environment in which Jansen releases
                them. The sculptures are also able to store air pressure in order to propel themselves in the absence of
                wind. Jansen's more sophisticated creations are able to detect when they have entered water and are able
                to move away from it. One model is capable of anchoring itself to the earth if an approaching storm is
                sensed.
                A 2016 episode of The Simpsons, "The Nightmare After Krustmas", featured the <em>strandbeesten</em> and
                Jansen. He provided the voice for his cartoon character. </p>
